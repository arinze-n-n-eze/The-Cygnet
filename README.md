Liquids and viscous substances as payload in a drone, can pose stability, control, and general performance challenges in flight when engaged in industrial work especially at low altitudes.  This problem impinges on the operational potential of industrial aerial robots and the numerous field functions they can perform.  i.Loss of control in-flight at low altitude is often non-recoverable for most industrial drones in the market today.   ii.The operational recommendations and collision avoidance capabilities limits the type of aerial work these drones can perform autonomously.  Our design harnesses the advantages of a pivot system suspended payload with respect to gravitational force, the mechanical qualities and direction of net force of a body in (flight) motion.  The design ensures that at any flight failure scenario leading to instability, the tension exerted on the suspended braces can demand the required power from relevant distributed power sources/ engines through actuators and servos on the wing structure for immediate recovery.
